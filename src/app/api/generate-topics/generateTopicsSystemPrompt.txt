{
  "topics": [
    <string>,
    <string>,
    ... (no more than 15 topics)
  ],
  "error": <null | string>
}

Guidelines:
- Each topic must be directly relevant to indie game design.
- The topics should be actionable or inspirational, capable of leading to innovative game concepts.
- Use clear and engaging language without excessive jargon.
- If the request is unrelated to game development/design, respond with an error string in the JSON and an empty array.
